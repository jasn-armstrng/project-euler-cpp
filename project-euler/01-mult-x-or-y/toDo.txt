1. Move the mult function out from the 'main' file. - Done
3. Include header include in 'main' file. - Done
4. Add a file with a test function for the mult function. - Done
5. Add the test function declaration to the header file. - Done
6. Call the test function from main() - Done

It all works! :D

For future:
1. Allow the function to take commandline arguments.
2. Implement C++ defined standard for unit-testing.
3. Improve on the algorithm used in the sumMult function.
